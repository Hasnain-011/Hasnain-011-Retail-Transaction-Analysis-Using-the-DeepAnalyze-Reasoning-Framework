
## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this study, **`retail_mart_final.csv`**, contains detailed retail transaction records. It captures information related to customer orders, product characteristics, sales performance, and operational indicators across different time periods.

### Key Characteristics

* **Number of Columns:** 20
* **Missing Values:** None (the dataset is complete and does not require imputation)
* **Data Type:** Structured tabular data stored in CSV format

### Main Feature Groups

The dataset features are organized into the following logical groups:

1. **Order and Time Information**
   Includes order identifiers and temporal attributes such as order date, month, or year, enabling time-based sales analysis.

2. **Product and Category Details**
   Contains product names, categories, and related attributes that help analyze product performance and category-level trends.

3. **Sales and Profit Metrics**
   Includes numerical measures such as sales revenue, profit, quantity sold, and discounts, which are essential for financial and performance analysis.

4. **Customer and Payment Information**
   Covers customer-related attributes and payment modes, supporting customer behavior and transaction pattern analysis.

5. **Inventory and Operational Indicators**
   Includes fields related to inventory status and operational efficiency, useful for supply chain and operational insights.

## Methodology: DeepAnalyze-Based Analysis

The analysis was conducted using the **DeepAnalyze framework**, which is designed for dataset-aware reasoning and structured insight extraction.

### Framework Setup

* The DeepAnalyze framework repository was cloned and examined to understand its architecture, reasoning flow, and analysis pipeline.
* Due to computational limitations, a **lightweight, compatible instruction-tuned language model** was selected and executed locally using **Google Colab**.

### Analysis Process

Following the DeepAnalyze reasoning methodology, the model was used to perform:

* **Column understanding** to identify the semantic meaning and role of each feature
* **Dataset-aware reasoning** to analyze relationships across different feature groups
* **Business insight extraction** to derive meaningful and actionable conclusions from the retail data

Despite using a lighter model, the analysis strictly adhered to the DeepAnalyze framework’s reasoning principles to ensure consistency, interpretability, and reliability of results.
